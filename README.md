# Assembly x86 Basics

In this repository I wrote various little assembly x86 programs (on Linux) to better learn assembly x86.

## Resources

<a href="https://syscall.sh/">syscall.sh</a> is a wonderful website for working with different architectures. It provides the syscall number for each system call (Based on the architecture), the parameters each syscall accepts, and the registers where each parameter should be placed.

<a href="https://godbolt.org/">godbolt.org</a> is a very nice website that can be used to retrieve assembly instructions, given high-level code. Useful to better understand how programs work on a deeper level.

<a href="https://dogbolt.org/">dogbolt.org</a> is a useful website that can be used to decompile programs in a browser.
